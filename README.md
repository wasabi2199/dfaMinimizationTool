# dfaMinimizationTool
Bachelor thesis project at FEI STU Bratislava

This project was created in 2021 as a part of my bachelor thesis - Minimization algorithms of deterministic finite automata. The aim of the bachelor thesis was to describe and compare selected minimization algorithms for deterministic finite automata. The resulting implementation should serve the educational purposes of the subject taught at FEI STU - Automata and formal languages.
